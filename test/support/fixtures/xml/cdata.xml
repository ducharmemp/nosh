Only 5 months after, a low-budget slasher film featuring the lovable bear turned into a homicidal maniac was announced, and less than a year later, <strong><em>Winnie-the-Pooh: Blood and Honey</em></strong> was released. The film&rsquo;s first announcement went viral and caused a wave of mixed reactions, Internet memes, and social media talk. However, this is far from the first time a famous children&rsquo;s book has been turned into a horror movie. Many classic characters have met the same fate as Pooh and Piglet, and their horrifying reimagined stories are a must-watch for all fans of the genre, or anyone looking to reinterpret (or ruin) their beloved childhood favorites.</p>

However, Aunt Marge&rsquo;s visit to Privet Drive didn&rsquo;t exactly go according to plan. The character makes no attempt to disguise her hatred for Harry, even telling Uncle Vernon: &ldquo;He&rsquo;d had been straight into an orphanage if he&rsquo;d been dumped on my doorstep, Vernon&rdquo;. The situation continues to escalate when Aunt Marge starts to badmouth <a href="https://gamerant.com/harry-potter-james-sacrifice-protect-lily-harry/">Harry&rsquo;s parents</a>, referring to the late James Potter as a &ldquo;drunk&rdquo;. In a memorable scene, Aunt Marge blames Harry&rsquo;s &lsquo;troubled&rsquo; personality on Lily Potter, declaring: &ldquo;If there&rsquo;s something wrong with the bitch, then there&rsquo;ll be something wrong with the pup&rdquo;. Understandably, Harry promptly loses his temper, but it&rsquo;s safe to say that Aunt Marge received her just deserts, making for one of the most iconic moments in the entire <strong><em>Harry Potter </em></strong>franchise.</p>

This is because Gen 9 games dared to defy some rules and traditions that had never been broken before, and this is a good thing for the series moving forward, especially after the success of <a href="https://gamerant.com/pokemon-legends-arceus-biggest-changes-core-pokemon-formula/"><em>Pokemon Legends: Arceus</em>&#39; different formula</a>. However, there is a strange pattern going on between <em>Pokemon Scarlet and Violet</em> and their first and second expansions, and the missing element (or elements) could be a great way to tease more content to come for Gen 9 - be it a sequel or third DLC.</p>

In truth, it seems like the MCU as a whole is really struggling to fire up fans and get them to come out to theatres. As demonstrated by <em>The Marvels</em>, moviegoers aren&rsquo;t willing to go out to see any average MCU movie that comes out anymore. Quality is key, and that couldn&rsquo;t be more true for Anthony Mackie&rsquo;s Sam Wilson in his first big-screen adventure as the character.</p>

During this period, players could also subscribe to PlayStation Now to gain access to a library of PS4, PS3, and some PS2 games.</p>

It makes sense that most of the non-mainline games in the series would lean more heavily into the third-person shooter aspects of <em>Resident Evil</em>&#39;s gameplay and afford players less restriction than the resource management and puzzle solving of the original trilogy, but the series&#39; continual ventures into action game territory has made most of the more recent spin-offs feel somewhat redundant. It&#39;s time for a new kind of <a href="http://gamerant.com/tag/resident-evil/"><em>Resident Evil</em></a> spin-off that leans more heavily into the careful encounter design of the original game via the turn-based tactics genre.</p>

While <em><a href="https://gamerant.com/tag/genshin-impact/">Genshin Impact</a></em> has been out for roughly three years, <em>Honkai: Star Rail</em> has only been out for roughly eight months. Although they have a lot of things in common, like both being gacha games, there are some player quality of life improvements that are present in <em>Star Rail</em> that <em>Genshin</em> lacks. These improvements range in use from new players to those at a high Trailblazer level. If brought to <em>Genshin</em> in some way, shape or form, it would be a boon to all players, regardless of where they&#39;re at in the story.</p>

Initially an outcast, she navigated a harsh world alone, honing her skills and courage in the process. However, when faced with the formidable Zeniths, a new level of threat emerged, necessitating a collaborative effort. Characters like Varl, Beta, Erend, Zo, Kotallo, Alva, and Sylens played crucial roles in supporting Aloy to overcome this challenge. These companions worked together at <a href="https://gamerant.com/horizon-forbidden-west-every-companion-base-visit/">the <em>Forbidden West</em> base</a> and stuck together despite the challenges. This cooperative dynamic not only showcases the strength of camaraderie but also sets the stage for a feature reminiscent of <em>God of War</em> in the upcoming <em>Horizon</em> installment.</p>

These characters are compelling, some to the point of controversy, and getting to know them more intimately can reveal a whole new dimension to the games they feature in. The best romances in the franchise aren&rsquo;t always the most fleshed-out ones, but they continue to be popular after players <a href="https://gamerant.com/mass-effect-legendary-edition-best-worst-things/">revisited the trilogy</a> through <em>Mass Effect: Legendary Edition</em>. From the <em>Mass Effect: Andromeda</em> lineup, the best romances may only have one game to introduce them, but they carry on the tradition of <em>Mass Effect</em> romances that make this franchise worth playing.</p>

Still, Gen 9 games are perhaps the single most influential entry in the mainline series by a huge margin, with spin-off titles like <em>Pokemon Legends: Arceus</em> spicing up the competition for the overall franchise. The main reason for this is that <a href="https://gamerant.com/tag/pokemon-scarlet-and-violet/"><em>Pokemon Scarlet and Violet</em></a> break multiple traditions, which is a great thing when it comes to a general sense of novelty and how much the games actually stand out compared to their predecessors.</p>

Meanwhile, other studios have decided to boldly step in and deliver their own takes on a spiritual successor or follow-up. This year alone has already seen the release of two games with more than their fair share of obvious <a href="https://gamerant.com/tag/bloodborne/"><em>Bloodborne</em></a> inspiration, and both titles happen to bring FromSoftware&#39;s PS4-exclusive to mind in different ways. <em>Lies of P</em> may have players covered as far as a 3D <em>Bloodborne</em>-like, but it&#39;s Kumi Souls&#39; <em>The Last Faith</em> that does an impressive job of imagining <em>Bloodborne</em> as a 2D Soulsvania.</p>

Monolith hasn&#39;t put out a game since 2017&#39;s <em>Middle-earth: Shadow of War</em>, and so many fans are understandably anxious to see more of its <em>Wonder Woman</em> project.</p>
